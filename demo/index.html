    <p>Salvation is the permanent solution Jesus gave for our reconciliation back to the Father.
      <b data-test='{"hello":"world"}'>Test</b>
      Salvation reconciles us back to the initial communion and fellowship the first man lost has a result sin
      through disobedience 2Cor 5:18, Col 1:1922, Romans 5:10 Salvation breach the gap/ separation sin caused, and
      it brings us to our rightful place in Christ with GOD.
    </p>
    <p>What then is SIN?<br>
      Sin is a willing disobedience to the will of GOD. Sin is going against God's commandment, and this have
      great consequences which includes spiritual death Romans 6: 23, separation from God.
      <br><br>
      Isaiah 59:. But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face
      from you, that he will not hear.
      Fellowship and communion was lost Gen 3:8. Finally the dominion we once had over all things was rolled over
      to the devil Luke 4:6
      <br><br>
      Where did sin originate from?<br>
      Adam (the first man) was the pioneer of sin Romans 5:12,14. He and eve disobeyed God and were sent out of
      the presence of God. Ever since then as atonement been made by animal sacrifices Lev 4:1-2000 which
      obviously wasn't a permanent solution to reconciling the sinful nature of man and Holiness of God until
      JESUS came.
      <br><br>
      What must I do to be saved?<br>
      Out of His abundant love He freely gave us his only begotten son Jesus, The Rev 3:16, Romans 5:8,
      matt 1: 21, Roms. 8:30, 1 cor 5:17-18, 1tim 1:15, 1thes 1: 10, 2corinthians 5:21, 'for He had made him to be
      sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him 2Peter4:5.'
