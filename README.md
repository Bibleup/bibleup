# Introduction 💫
BibleUp makes bible references on a webpage easily accessible without the need of opening on a new window.

It searches for all bible references on a page and transforms each one to a link. Hovering on these links will make the bible text accessible via a feature-rich and flexible hover popup.

At its core, BibleUp is a blend of an internal API and a display interface.
