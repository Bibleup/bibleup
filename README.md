A tool for converting Bible references on a webpage to links with accessible popup<br>
</p>
<br>

> BibleUp is currently in **beta**. However, it can be used without much worry or concern for breaking changes.

# Introduction
BibleUp makes bible references on a webpage easily accessible without the need of leaving the page.
It searches for all Bible references on a page and transforms each one to a link. Hovering on these links will make the Bible text accessible via a feature-rich and flexible hover popup.
<br><br>
BibleUp is a blend of an internal API and a display interface.
