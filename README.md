# BibleupJS

**BibleupJS** is a tool for converting all bible references on a webpage to links with an accessible popup.<br>
BibleUp makes bible verses and references on a webpage easily accessible and readable. It searches for all biblical references in a page (e.g, John 3:16)
and transforms each one to a link, and makes the main bible text accessible with a popup.
