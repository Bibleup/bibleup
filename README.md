# BibleupJS

**BibleupJS** is a tool for converting all bible references on a webpage to links, with a popup to access bible text<br>

BibleUp makes bible verses and references on a webpage easily accessible and readable.<br> It searches for all biblical references in a page (e.g, John 3:16)
and transforms each one to a link, and makes the bible text accessible via a popup.
